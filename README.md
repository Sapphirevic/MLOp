# MLOp

Machine Learning Zoomcamp 1

Training a dataset to predict the salaries of data scientists.

one hot encoding could be done with dict vectorizer and dummies.
s\_** = pd.get_dummies(s, columns=**\_cols)

5 MLOPs automation levels(0 - 4)

1. No mlops - working in notebooks
2. Devops but no mlops - preparing for mloops
3. Automated training - In production model, testing.
4. Automated Deployment - automatically deploying the model after training.
5. Full mlops automation -

Experiment tracking - keeping track of relevant info from machine learning experiments.

optimization tools - hyperparameters

ML run is a trail in an ML experiment

Model Management
log_artifact - to save the model
